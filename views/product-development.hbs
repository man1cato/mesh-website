          Have a problem, but not a solution? The first step is to understand as much as you can about the problem.
          Who are the people suffering from this problem? What is their biggest pain point? What factors are constributing
          to the problem? Is there anyone already trying to solve this problem? If so, how are they approaching it? Through
          guided research, we can uncover the answers to these questions and more.

          Once you have a solid idea for a product, and you've vetted it with potential customers, the next step is to
          build a Minimum Viable Product. We pinpoint the most important customer needs that your solution must
          meet, then brainstorm potential solutions, ultimately narrowing it down to the one that will be prototyped.
          That prototype will be developed, tested, and refined until we have something that a customer is willing to pay for.
